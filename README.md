## Specifications of the Project

- [x] **Create Listing**: Users should be able to visit a page to create a new listing.
- [x] **Active Listings Page**
- [ ] **Listing Page**
    - [ ] **Watchlist**: Add item to watchlist; if the item is already there, remove it.
    - [ ] **Bidding**: User should be able to bid on the item. The bid must be at least as large as the starting bid and greater than any other bids that have been placed. If a user is signed in on a closed listing page, and the user has won that auction, the page should say so.

- [ ] **Comments**: Users who are signed in should be able to add comments to the listing page.
- [ ] **Categories**: Users should be able to categorize listings.
